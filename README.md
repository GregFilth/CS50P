# CS50P
These are my submitted tasks made during my journey with Harvard's fantastic CS50P course.

I had close-to-zero knowledge about programming with Python previously.
Started the course on 9th September, 2023 and finished my final task on 15th October, 2023.

Now next step is the original CS50x course!
